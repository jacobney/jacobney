I’m @jacobney. I'm a graduate research assistant and M.S. student at Colorado State University. 
I’m interested in the development and testing of wildland fire behavior models.
My current research compares predictions of crown fire between WFDS, QUIC-Fire, Rothermel, and CFIS.
I’m currently learning to code in R, Linux, and Python. 
I’m looking to collaborate on future research.
